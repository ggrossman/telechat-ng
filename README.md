telechat-ng
===========

I (Gary Grossman) am the original author of the Unix/CB code that was the foundation
for the Vrave server that ran for many years on hyperreal.org. That code eventually
found its way into an open source project called "telechat" maintained by
Constantin Kaplinsky. The lineage of this code is explained on this page
http://hyperreal.org/raves/vrave/:

>If you're curious to inspect vrave's code, which is written in C, you
 can't; the vrave code that was running on Hyperreal is not in the
 public domain. However, you can view the source of a related server
 called Telechat. Vrave and Telechat are both based on a very old
 application called Unix-CB. The actual lineage went: Unix-CB ->
 Unix-CB w/modifications (the original Vrave) -> Vrave (when the
 Unix-CB author said it was OK to change the name) -> Hotwired Chat
 (with proprietary features) -> Telechat 1.0 (with Hotwired's features
 removed).

Back in 2000, I was curious as to whether my Unix/CB code had ended up in any
kind of open source project, and through whatever search engine was state of the
art at the time, I found this code for "telechat-ng."

I downloaded this code from http://www.ce.cctpu.edu.ru/telechat-ng/ in June 2000.
Since that site is no longer up, I figured I would commit it to Github for
posterity.
